# CSV Input File #
The CSV Input file is used to pass along a minimal amount of host specific information to the script. It can contain one or hosts, with each host getting a line within the file.

It contains the following information:
* __Name__ - This is the FQDN of the host being added (or IP address if DNS/FQDN is not used for some reason)
